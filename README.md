#Chat Application
This is a real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend and Socket.io for the backend. The app provides users with the ability to communicate with each other in a live environment, sending and receiving messages instantly.

##Project Structure
The project consists of two main folders:

client: This folder contains the frontend built with React.js.
server: This folder contains the backend that handles socket connections using Socket.io.
Client Folder
The client folder houses the React.js components responsible for rendering and managing the user interface. The components include:

1. ChatBar.js: A component that provides the input interface for users to send messages.
2. ChatFooter.js: Displays additional elements, such as footer information or status indicators.
3. Home.js: The landing page or home page where users can initiate the chat session.
4. ChatPage.js: The page where the active chat session is displayed, along with the chat interface.
5. ChatBody.js: Responsible for rendering the list of messages exchanged between users in the current chat session.


Server Folder
The server folder contains the backend logic for the app, using Node.js and Socket.io to handle real-time communication.

1. index.js: This file contains the main server-side code that initializes the Socket.io server and handles the backend processes such as establishing and managing socket connections, broadcasting messages, and handling events.
Features
2. Real-time messaging: Instant message delivery between users through Socket.io.
3. User Interface: A clean, simple, and responsive UI built with React.
4. Message history: The app can display a conversation history in real-time.


Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm are required to run both the client and server.
Download and install Node.js from nodejs.org.
Setup
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-folder>
Navigate to the server folder and install dependencies.

bash
Copy
cd server
npm install
Navigate to the client folder and install dependencies.

bash
Copy
cd client
npm install
Start the server.

In the server folder:

bash
Copy
npm start
Start the client.

In the client folder:

bash
Copy
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000, and the backend server will be running on http://localhost:5000 (default ports).

#Usage
Once both the client and server are running:

Open the app in your browser (default: http://localhost:3000).
Users can interact with the Home.js page to initiate a chat.
ChatPage.js will display the live chat interface with messages exchanged in real-time.
The ChatBar.js allows the user to type and send messages, and ChatFooter.js may contain useful information or status about the connection.
Technologies Used
1. Frontend: React.js, JSX, CSS
2. Backend: Node.js, Socket.io
3. Package Manager: npm
4. Real-time Communication: Socket.io for bidirectional event-based communication
